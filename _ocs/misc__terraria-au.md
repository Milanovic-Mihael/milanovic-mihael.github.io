  finally tipped beyond repair. The Four Grand Seals of the Moon Prisoner now lie
  vulnerable on the continent of Terraria. <br><br> The news of the event reached
  far and wide, ultimately prompting many strong figures to act. Some seek to aid
  his endeavors, and others to halt him. <br><br> Regardless of the actions taken
  by the pinions, one truth of the world always remains: <br><br><br> The pendulum
  always swings back.'
